# NLP Project: Analysis and Classification of Modi's Tweets

This repository contains tools and models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks focused on analyzing and classifying tweets related to Narendra Modi.

## Dataset
The dataset used (`Modi_Tweets.csv`) includes tweets with sentiment labels (-1, 0, 1) and text content. Initial preprocessing includes handling null values and converting categorical labels to integers for classification tasks.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Null values are dropped from the dataset to ensure data quality.
2. **Text Processing**: Text data is processed using TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.

## Models Implemented
### XGBoost Classifier
- Implemented a multi-class XGBoost classifier to predict sentiment labels.
- Utilized TF-IDF vectors of text data for training and testing.

### Random Forest Classifier
- Employed a Random Forest classifier for sentiment analysis.
- Utilized TF-IDF vectors similarly for feature representation.

### Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Implemented Gradient Boosting to analyze tweet sentiments.
- Used TF-IDF for feature extraction and model training.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Used SVM with linear kernel for classification tasks.
- Applied TF-IDF vectors for text representation and achieved competitive accuracy.

### LSTM Neural Network
- Employed a deep learning model with LSTM for sentiment analysis.
- Used tokenization and word embeddings for text representation.

### Bagging and Boosting Techniques
- Implemented Bagging and Boosting techniques using XGBoost as base estimator.
- Demonstrated improved performance through ensemble methods.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks or scripts to reproduce analyses and models.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved competitive accuracies across models, with detailed performance metrics in classification reports.

## Future Work
- Explore deep learning architectures like Transformer models for improved sentiment analysis.
- Enhance preprocessing techniques for better data cleaning and feature engineering.
